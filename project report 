Project Report: Simple ATM Machine (Python)

1. Introduction

For this project, I made a small ATM program in Python
The main purpose was to practice how functions, loops and basic logic work together in a simple application. The user can create an account, log in with a PIN and then use options like deposit, withdraw and checking balance.

2. Objective

My goal was to build something simple but useful so I can understand:

how to take input from the user,

how to store data in a dictionary,

how to create a menu-based program,

and how different functions connect with each other.

3. Tools Used

I only used Python 3.
No external libraries were required

4. How the System Works

When the program starts, the user sees a small main menu with three options:

1. Create a new account


2. Login


3. Exit



Account Storage

All accounts are saved inside a dictionary called accounts.
Each account simply stores two things:

the PIN

the current balance


Example:
"1010": {"pin": "1234", "balance": 500}

ATM Menu

After login, the user gets these options:

Deposit

Withdraw

Check balance

Logout


Each option runs through its own function to keep things neat

5. Functions in the Program

create_account() – makes a new account with PIN

login() – checks account number and PIN

deposit() – adds amount to balance

withdraw() – subtracts amount if balance is enough

check_balance() – shows the balance

atm_menu() – handles all inside-ATM options

main() – the starting point of the whole program

6. Program Flow

The user chooses an option from the main menu.

If they create an
